# StudentApplication_E_To_E

  This application is sample project for Demonstration of Student and Teacher application.
  
  - I have used a Spring for Back End and AngularJS for Front End.
  - For the Front End design purpose I have used Angular Material and Bootstrap also.
  - In Back End I have added some dependencies in order to perform some activites.
  - In this we have a two users called Normal user where he has to register and another user is Admin user i.e., in order to login as Admin he has to give User Name and Password as **admin**.
  - When the user will login as admin he can navigate to Admin Dashboard and when user login he will navigate to User Dashboard.
  - As a Admin he can register as a Teacher and he can view the students, make the result whether student is passed or fail.
  - In this project we have a feature to upload a file whether student is pass or fail for the verification of student and this file will loaded in particular folder in the system.
  - This file is for student to verify hihs/her result.
  - And I have also implemented Swagger in Spring.
